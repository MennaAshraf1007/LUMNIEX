 Luminex was created as part of our database course (CSEN501) to showcase our skills in designing and implementing a fully functional telecom company website. This project represents our ability to integrate complex database systems with a seamless and user-friendly front-end experience. At Luminex,
 we aim to provide a platform that not only demonstrates our technical expertise
 but also offers a glimpse into the future of telecom services.
 From managing user accounts and transactions to handling service plans and rewards,
 every feature of this website reflects our commitment to innovation and excellence in database management.
 Join us on this journey as we redefine connectivity and deliver exceptional user experiences.
